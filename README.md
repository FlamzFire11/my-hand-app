# Hand tracker app
This is a hand tracker app that will be part of my research project ^_^


## Features
- Shows fps of the camera
- Shows *SOME* gestures
- Shows coordinates of fingers on the camera
- Can adjust camera sensitivity

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
